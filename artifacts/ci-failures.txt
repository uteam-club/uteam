CI Failures Analysis
===================

Current Workflow: .github/workflows/gps-ci.yml

Problematic Jobs:
1. e2e-tests (lines 63-105):
   - Requires DATABASE_URL secret
   - Installs Playwright browsers (heavy)
   - Depends on database connection
   - Uses continue-on-error: true (indicates instability)

2. readiness-check (lines 107-134):
   - Requires DATABASE_URL secret
   - Runs tsx scripts/gps/readiness-check.ts (needs DB)
   - Uses continue-on-error: true (indicates instability)

3. summary (lines 136-170):
   - Depends on all jobs including problematic ones
   - May fail if e2e-tests or readiness-check fail

Root Causes:
- Database dependencies in e2e-tests and readiness-check
- Heavy browser installation for Playwright
- Missing secrets in CI environment
- No proper error handling for missing dependencies

Solution:
- Create gps-ci-lite.yml with code-only checks
- Move E2E to manual workflow
- Create code-only readiness check
- Disable old workflow on main branch
